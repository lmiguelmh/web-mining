 The situation, in fact, does not appear to be that simple. The unanticipated resistance from guerrilla forces in the south and the limited size of the American force in the region has slowed the tempo of the war plan.

 Such a move could give the allies more forces to take on the Republican Guard, gain control of the cities in the south and stifle resistance from paramilitary units there and guard supply lines.

 The sequencing suggests how the bacteria went wrong. Nearly a third of its genome consists of mobile elements of DNA on its chromosomes and in self-contained packets called plasmids. The toxic effects and drug resistance are a result of this mobile DNA.

 Dr. Paulsen said that the greatest significance of the sequencing was in ''finding how much genetic exchange has gone on in the evolution of this pathogen.'' It is, he said, ''easy to transfer resistance genes among enterococcus bacteria and to other things like staphylococcus.'' 
------
 Drug-resistant staphylococcus is a major problem for hospitals and, Dr. Paulsen said, one or two strains had ''virtually certainly gained resistance genes from an enterococcus.''

 The Second Symphony was Ullmann's final composition, written in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, and left incomplete -- in a piano version, with scoring annotations -- when he was sent to Auschwitz. Like ''Der Kaiser von Atlantis'' and some of the chamber music he wrote in Theresienstadt, this work moves freely between styles, with Mahler prominent among the influences. It has some powerful ideas, most notably a finale in which a Hebrew folk song, a Hussite hymn with Czech nationalist connotations and a Lutheran chorale are juxtaposed as a message of resistance.

 Mr. Arnett then dug himself back in by telling an Iraqi interviewer that his reports about civilian casualties and the resistance of Iraqi forces helped the antiwar movement in the United States.

 They appear to have largely stabilised over the last month following their April to August swoon but were giving up ground again ahead of U.S. trading. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 1.5 percent at $46.45 per barrel and Brent back under $50 a barrel to $48.90.
